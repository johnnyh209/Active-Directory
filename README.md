# Active-Directory

This is a project where I confiure a Windows Domain and Active Directory. The following technology will be used: VirtualBox, Windows Server 2019, and Windows 10 Enterprise. 

**Step 1:** Because I will be using VirtualBox to practice configuring a Windows Domain/Active Directory, I want to make sure that my computer has virtualization capabilities enabled. To do so, I opened up Task Manager and click into the Performance tab. I then clicked into the CPU section, and checked that virtualization is indeed enabled. Refer to the image below.

**Step 2:** With virtualization enabeled, I preceeded to install VirtualBox.

Once the installation has completed, I was presented with the main page of the application:

**Step 3:** Once VirtualBox was set up, I needed to grab the .iso files for both Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 Enterprise. Windows Server 2019 will be used as the manager (where we will be configuring Active Directory on), and Windows 10 Enterprise will represent employees (admin (super) users, regular users, guest users).
